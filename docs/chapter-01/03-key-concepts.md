# Chapter 1: Key Concepts

This section introduces the fundamental concepts that underpin Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Embodied Cognition

The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the environment. In Physical AI, this means intelligence emerges from the interaction between the system's physical form and its environment.

## Action-Perception Loop

A continuous cycle where:
1. The system perceives its environment
2. Processes the sensory information
3. Decides on an action
4. Executes the action
5. Observes the results
6. Repeats the cycle

## Multi-Modal Integration

The ability to process and combine information from multiple sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch, proprioception) to form a coherent understanding of the environment.

## Real-Time Constraints

Physical systems must respond within strict timing constraints to maintain stability and safety. This requires efficient algorithms and optimized hardware.

## Sensorimotor Coordination

The integration of sensory input with motor output to achieve purposeful behavior. This is crucial for tasks like manipulation and navigation.

## Physical Reasoning

The ability to understand and predict the physical properties and behaviors of objects and environments, enabling effective interaction with the physical world.

Understanding these concepts is essential for developing effective Physical AI systems.
