Welcome to the first chapter of our comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental concepts that underpin the entire field of embodied artificial intelligence.

## About This Chapter

This chapter is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in Physical AI, covering its definition, historical context, and key principles. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how Physical AI differs from traditional AI approaches and appreciate the importance of embodiment in intelligent systems.

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

- **[Introduction to Physical AI](./intro-physical-ai)**: Understanding the definition and scope of Physical AI, its relationship to embodied intelligence, and its applications
- **[Learning Outcomes](./learning-outcomes)**: Clear objectives that define what you'll be able to accomplish after studying this chapter
- **[Key Concepts](./key-concepts)**: Detailed explanations of the core ideas that form the foundation of Physical AI
- **[Exercises](./exercises)**: Practical problems and activities to reinforce your understanding

## Learning Path

After completing this chapter, you'll be well-prepared to move on to Chapter 2, where we'll explore the robotic nervous system using ROS 2. The concepts covered here form the theoretical foundation for all subsequent chapters in this book.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of artificial intelligence concepts
- Familiarity with programming concepts (preferably Python)
- Interest in robotics and physical systems

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this chapter, continue with our exploration of the robotic nervous system in Chapter 2, where we'll dive into ROS 2 and the communication frameworks that enable Physical AI systems to operate effectively in the real world.
