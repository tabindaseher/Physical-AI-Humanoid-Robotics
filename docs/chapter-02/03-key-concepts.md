# Chapter 2: Key Concepts

This section introduces the fundamental concepts in humanoid robotics.

## Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

The number of independent movements a robot can make. Humanoid robots typically require high DOF to mimic human motion.

## Inverse Kinematics

The mathematical process of determining joint angles required to position the robot's end effector at a desired location.

## Center of Mass (CoM)

The point where the robot's mass is concentrated, critical for maintaining balance and stability.

## Zero Moment Point (ZMP)

A criterion for dynamic balance in walking robots, ensuring the robot doesn't tip over.

## Control Architecture

The hierarchical structure that organizes robot control from high-level planning to low-level actuator commands.

## Sensory Integration

The combination of data from multiple sensors to create a coherent understanding of the robot's state and environment.

## Biomechanics

The study of biological systems that inspires the design of humanoid robots, particularly in terms of movement and structure.
