# Chapter 2: Exercises

## Conceptual Exercises

1. **Design Analysis**: Analyze the design of a humanoid robot (e.g., ASIMO, Atlas, Optimus) and identify how it addresses the challenges of humanoid robotics.

2. **DOF Calculation**: Calculate the minimum degrees of freedom required for a humanoid robot to perform basic human-like tasks (walking, reaching, grasping).

3. **Balance Assessment**: Explain how ZMP control helps maintain balance in bipedal robots.

## Practical Exercises

4. **Simulation Setup**: Set up a basic humanoid robot model in a simulation environment (Gazebo, Webots, or similar).

5. **Kinematics**: Implement inverse kinematics for a simple robotic arm using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention.

6. **Balance Control**: Implement a simple balance controller for a bipedal robot in simulation.

## Research Exercises

7. **Literature Review**: Research and summarize three recent advances in humanoid robotics, focusing on their technical innovations.

8. **Comparison Study**: Compare the approaches taken by different humanoid robot platforms to solve common challenges like walking and manipulation.
