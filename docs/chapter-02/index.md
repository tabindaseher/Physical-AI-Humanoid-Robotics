# Chapter 2: Architecture - Foundations of Humanoid Robotics (ROS 2)

In this chapter, we'll explore ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system of modern robotics applications. Understanding ROS 2 is critical for Physical AI systems as it provides the communication infrastructure that enables different components to interact effectively.

## About This Chapter

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to ROS 2 architecture, covering its design principles, communication patterns, and practical implementation. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how to build distributed robotic systems using ROS 2's communication primitives.

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

- **[Foundations of Humanoid Architecture](./foundations-humanoid)**: Understanding ROS 2 architecture, communication patterns, and system design
- **[Learning Outcomes](./learning-outcomes)**: Clear objectives that define what you'll be able to accomplish after studying this chapter
- **[Key Concepts](./key-concepts)**: Detailed explanations of the core ROS 2 concepts and architectural patterns
- **[Exercises](./exercises)**: Practical problems and activities to reinforce your understanding

## Learning Path

This chapter builds directly on the Physical AI concepts introduced in Chapter 1, applying those principles to the specific architecture of ROS 2. The knowledge gained here will be essential when we explore simulation environments in Chapter 3, as ROS 2 provides the bridge between simulated and real robotic systems.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should have:

- Completion of Chapter 1 (Introduction to Physical AI)
- Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Programming experience in C++ or Python
- Familiarity with Linux command line tools

## Next Steps

After mastering ROS 2 architecture in this chapter, you'll be well-prepared to explore simulation environments in Chapter 3, where we'll examine how ROS 2 integrates with simulation tools like Gazebo and Unity to create digital twins of robotic systems.
