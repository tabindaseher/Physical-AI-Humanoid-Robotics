# Appendix D: VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Implementation

## Understanding VLA Systems

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems combine:
- Computer vision for environmental perception
- Language processing for command understanding
- Action execution for physical manipulation

## Implementation Architecture

### Vision Component
- Camera input processing
- Object detection and recognition
- Scene understanding

### Language Component
- Natural language processing
- Command parsing
- Intent recognition

### Action Component
- Task planning
- Motion planning
- Execution control

## Integration Patterns

### Sequential Processing
1. Vision → Language → Action
2. Process each component in sequence

### Parallel Processing
1. Vision and language processing in parallel
2. Combined decision making
3. Action execution
