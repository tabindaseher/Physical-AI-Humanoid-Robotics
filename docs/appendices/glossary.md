# Glossary

## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other.

## B

**Backend**: The server-side of a system that handles data storage, processing, and business logic.

## C

**Control Loop**: A process that continuously monitors and adjusts a system to maintain desired behavior.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical object or system that can be used for simulation and analysis.

## E

**Embodiment**: The concept of AI systems having a physical form that interacts with the real world.

## F

**Frontend**: The client-side of a system that users interact with directly.

## H

**Humanoid**: A robot designed to resemble and move like a human.

## I

**Isaac**: NVIDIA's simulation and AI platform for robotics.

## L

**Latency**: The time delay between a stimulus and response in a system.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications.

## P

**Physical AI**: AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world.

**Perception**: The process by which robots interpret sensory information from their environment.

## R

**Real-time**: Systems that must respond within strict timing constraints.

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software.

## S

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: Systems that combine visual perception, language understanding, and physical action.
