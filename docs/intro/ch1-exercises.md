# Chapter 1: Exercises

## Conceptual Exercises

1. **Compare and Contrast**: Create a table comparing traditional AI systems with Physical AI systems across dimensions like environment, real-time requirements, safety considerations, and learning mechanisms.

2. **Application Analysis**: Identify three potential applications of Physical AI in your daily environment. For each application, describe the required sensory capabilities, decision-making processes, and actuation requirements.

3. **Challenge Identification**: List five specific challenges that would arise when deploying a Physical AI system in a public space (e.g., shopping mall, airport) and propose potential solutions for each.

## Research Exercises

4. **Literature Review**: Research and summarize three recent papers on Physical AI. Compare their approaches to embodiment, perception, and action.

5. **Technology Survey**: Investigate current hardware platforms for Physical AI (e.g., humanoid robots, mobile manipulators). Compare their capabilities, limitations, and target applications.

## Design Exercises

6. **System Architecture**: Sketch a high-level architecture for a Physical AI system designed to assist elderly individuals in their homes. Include perception, reasoning, and action components.

7. **Safety Considerations**: Design a safety framework for a Physical AI system operating in a mixed human-robot environment. Consider fail-safe mechanisms, emergency stops, and collision avoidance.

## Hands-on Exercises

8. **Simulation Setup**: Set up a basic simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo, Webots) and implement a simple robot that can navigate to a target while avoiding obstacles.

9. **Sensory Integration**: Implement a basic multi-modal perception system that combines camera and LIDAR data to detect and classify objects in a simulated environment.

10. **Behavior Design**: Design and implement a simple behavior for a robot that demonstrates the action-perception loop (e.g., approach and grasp an object).
