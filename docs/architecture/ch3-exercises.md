# Chapter 3: Exercises

## ROS2 Implementation Exercises

1. **Node Creation**: Create a simple ROS2 node that publishes sensor data and another that subscribes to it.

2. **Service Implementation**: Implement a ROS2 service that performs a specific robot task (e.g., calculating inverse kinematics).

3. **Action Server**: Create an action server for a long-running robot task with feedback and cancellation.

## Communication Pattern Exercises

4. **Topic Design**: Design a topic-based communication architecture for a humanoid robot's perception system.

5. **QoS Configuration**: Configure Quality of Service settings for different types of robot data (critical control vs. logging data).

6. **TF Tree**: Create and manage a TF tree for a humanoid robot with multiple sensors and links.

## System Integration Exercises

7. **Launch File**: Create a launch file that starts multiple nodes for a complete robot subsystem.

8. **Parameter Management**: Implement parameter management for robot configuration across different environments.

9. **System Monitoring**: Create tools to monitor the health and status of ROS2 nodes in a humanoid robot system.
