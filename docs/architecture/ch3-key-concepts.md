# Chapter 3: Key Concepts

## Nodes and Processes
Independent computational units that perform specific functions in the robot system.

## Topics and Message Passing
Asynchronous communication channels that enable data sharing between nodes.

## Services and Actions
Synchronous and asynchronous request-response patterns for task execution.

## Quality of Service (QoS)
Configurable policies that determine how messages are handled in terms of reliability, durability, and performance.

## TF (Transforms)
System for managing coordinate frames and transformations between different parts of the robot and environment.

## Launch Files
Declarative configuration files that specify which nodes to start and how to configure them.

## Parameters
Configuration values that can be set at runtime and modified during operation.

## Actions
Long-running tasks with feedback, goal, and result messages for complex robot behaviors.

## Lifecycle Nodes
Nodes with managed states (unconfigured, inactive, active) for complex system management.
