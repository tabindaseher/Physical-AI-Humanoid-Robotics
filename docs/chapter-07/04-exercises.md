# Chapter 6: Exercises

## VLA Model Exercises

1. **Model Integration**: Integrate a pre-trained VLA model with a simulated humanoid robot.

2. **Command Execution**: Implement a system that allows the robot to follow natural language commands using VLA models.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the success rate of VLA-based task execution in various scenarios.

## Multi-Modal Learning Exercises

4. **Vision Processing**: Create a pipeline that processes visual input for VLA model consumption.

5. **Language Understanding**: Implement natural language processing for robot command interpretation.

6. **Action Mapping**: Map VLA model outputs to specific robot actions and trajectories.

## Safety and Validation Exercises

7. **Safety Mechanisms**: Implement safety checks for VLA-driven robot behaviors.

8. **Failure Detection**: Create systems to detect when VLA models produce unsafe or incorrect actions.

9. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Design interfaces for human oversight of VLA-driven robot behaviors.
