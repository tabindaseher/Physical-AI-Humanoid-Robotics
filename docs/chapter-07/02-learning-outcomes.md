# Chapter 6: Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain the concept and benefits of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in robotics
2. Implement VLA model integration with humanoid robot platforms
3. Evaluate the performance and limitations of VLA models
4. Design safety mechanisms for VLA-driven robot behaviors
5. Fine-tune pre-trained VLA models for specific robot tasks
6. Compare VLA approaches with traditional robotics methods
7. Assess the real-time performance requirements for VLA systems
