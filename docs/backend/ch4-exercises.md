# Chapter 4: Exercises

## Simulation Setup Exercises

1. **Robot Model**: Create a URDF model of a simple humanoid robot with basic joints and links.

2. **Environment Creation**: Design a Gazebo world with obstacles and objects for robot testing.

3. **Sensor Configuration**: Add and configure cameras, LiDAR, and IMU sensors on your simulated robot.

## Physics and Dynamics Exercises

4. **Dynamics Tuning**: Adjust physical properties (mass, friction, damping) to achieve realistic robot behavior.

5. **Collision Detection**: Test and tune collision detection parameters for safe robot operation.

6. **Controller Integration**: Implement basic controllers in simulation and test their performance.

## Advanced Simulation Exercises

7. **Domain Randomization**: Implement domain randomization techniques to improve sim-to-real transfer.

8. **Unity Integration**: Create a Unity scene that mirrors your Gazebo simulation for high-fidelity visualization.

9. **Validation**: Compare simulation results with expected real-world behavior to validate your digital twin.
