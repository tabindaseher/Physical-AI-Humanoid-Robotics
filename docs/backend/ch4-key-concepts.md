# Chapter 4: Key Concepts

## Digital Twin
A virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors its properties and behavior.

## Physics Simulation
Computational modeling of real-world physics including mass, friction, collision, and dynamics.

## URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
XML format for representing robot models including links, joints, and inertial properties.

## SDF (Simulation Description Format)
Format for describing objects and environments in Gazebo simulation.

## Sensor Simulation
Virtual sensors that produce data similar to their real-world counterparts with realistic noise and limitations.

## Domain Randomization
Technique of randomizing simulation parameters to improve sim-to-real transfer.

## Gazebo Plugins
Extensions that add functionality to the Gazebo simulator for custom sensors, controllers, or physics.

## TF in Simulation
Coordinate frame management that connects simulated robot components and sensors.

## World Files
Description of environments including objects, lighting, and physics properties.

## Collision Detection
Algorithms for detecting when objects in simulation make contact.
