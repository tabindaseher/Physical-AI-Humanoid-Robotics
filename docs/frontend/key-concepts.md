# Frontend: Key Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts needed to understand frontend development for Physical AI and humanoid robotics systems.

## Core Concepts

1. **User Interface Architecture**: Understanding the structure of robot interfaces
2. **Real-time Data Visualization**: Techniques for displaying live robot data
3. **Remote Operation Interfaces**: Designing interfaces for remote robot control
4. **Data Streaming**: Handling continuous data streams from robots
5. **Security Considerations**: Ensuring secure communication in robot interfaces
6. **Responsive Design**: Creating interfaces that work across different devices
7. **Accessibility**: Making robot interfaces accessible to all users

## Implementation Patterns

- Dashboard interfaces for monitoring robot status
- Control panels for commanding robot actions
- Visualization tools for sensor data
- Logging and debugging interfaces
- Configuration management UIs
