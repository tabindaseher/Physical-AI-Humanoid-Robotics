# Frontend: Exercises

These exercises will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of frontend development for Physical AI and humanoid robotics systems.

## Exercise 1: Basic Robot Dashboard
Create a simple dashboard that displays basic robot status information such as:
- Battery level
- Current mode (idle, active, error)
- Connection status
- Position or location (if available)

## Exercise 2: Control Interface
Design and implement a control interface that allows users to:
- Send basic movement commands to a simulated robot
- Adjust robot parameters (speed, sensitivity, etc.)
- Switch between different control modes

## Exercise 3: Data Visualization
Create visualizations for robot sensor data such as:
- Plotting sensor readings over time
- Displaying camera feeds or point clouds
- Creating heat maps for sensor coverage

## Exercise 4: Remote Operation Panel
Build a remote operation interface that includes:
- Emergency stop functionality
- Task selection and execution controls
- Communication status indicators
- Safety monitoring features

## Exercise 5: Mobile Interface
Adapt your interface for mobile devices with:
- Touch-optimized controls
- Responsive layout design
- Offline capability considerations
