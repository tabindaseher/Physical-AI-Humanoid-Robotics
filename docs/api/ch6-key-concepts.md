# Chapter 6: Key Concepts

## Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrated models that combine visual perception, language understanding, and action execution.

## End-to-End Learning
Training models to map directly from inputs (vision, language) to outputs (actions) without intermediate symbolic representations.

## Foundation Models
Large-scale pre-trained models that can be adapted to various downstream tasks.

## Robotics Transformer
Transformer architecture applied to robotics tasks, enabling attention-based learning across modalities.

## Multi-Modal Fusion
Combining information from different sensory modalities (vision, language) for decision making.

## Imitation Learning
Learning robot behaviors by observing and replicating expert demonstrations.

## Reinforcement Learning
Learning through trial and error with reward signals for desired behaviors.

## Spatial Reasoning
Understanding and reasoning about objects and their relationships in physical space.

## Task Generalization
Ability to perform new tasks not seen during training.

## Zero-Shot Learning
Performing tasks without specific training on those tasks.
