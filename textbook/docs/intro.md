## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a fundamental paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to embodied intelligence systems. Unlike digital AI that operates on abstract data in virtual environments, Physical AI systems are grounded in physical reality, interacting with the real world through sensors and actuators.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into the following modules:

- **Foundations of Physical AI**: Core concepts and principles
- **ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System**: Middleware and communication
- **Simulation & Digital Twins**: Gazebo and Unity environments
- **NVIDIA Isaac - AI-Robot Brain**: Perception and planning
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Multimodal AI systems
- **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid System**: Complete integration

## Learning Objectives

After completing this textbook, students will be able to:

1. Distinguish between digital AI and Physical AI systems
2. Understand how AI agents interface with ROS 2 systems
3. Conceptually design a humanoid robot architecture that integrates all covered modules
4. Apply vision-language-action principles to embodied systems

## Academic Rigor

This textbook maintains university-level depth and precision with:
- Minimum 15 academic sources (50%+ peer-reviewed research papers)
- APA citation style throughout
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 readability level
- Content structured for both human learning and AI retrieval
