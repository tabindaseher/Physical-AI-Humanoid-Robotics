B) Computation performed by the agent's morphology (body structure)
C) Mathematical calculations for robot design
D) Cloud-based computation for robots

**Answer: B** - Computation performed by the agent's morphology (body structure)

## Short Answer Questions

### Question 6
Explain the difference between digital AI and Physical AI systems, providing at least two advantages and two limitations of each approach.

**Sample Answer**: Digital AI operates on abstract data in virtual environments with advantages of scalability and reproducibility, but limitations include the reality gap and lack of physical interaction. Physical AI is embodied and interacts with the real world with advantages of real-world relevance and environmental adaptation, but limitations include higher complexity and safety considerations.

### Question 7
Describe the four core principles of embodied intelligence and provide an example of how each might apply to a humanoid robot.

**Sample Answer**:
1. Embodiment constraint - A humanoid robot's physical form influences its cognitive processes (e.g., arm length affects reachable space)
2. Environmental coupling - The robot's cognition extends into the environment (e.g., using environmental features as external memory)
3. Structural coupling - The robot and environment shape each other (e.g., the robot learns to modify the environment to support its tasks)
4. Grounded cognition - Understanding emerges from sensorimotor experience (e.g., learning "softness" through physical interaction)

### Question 8
What is the "reality gap" problem in robotics and AI? Describe two approaches to address this issue.

**Sample Answer**: The reality gap is the performance difference between AI systems in simulation versus the real world. Approaches to address it include domain randomization (training in varied simulated environments) and sim-to-real transfer techniques that account for differences between simulation and reality.

### Question 9
Explain how LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs contribute to humanoid robot perception, and describe one application where each sensor type is particularly important.

**Sample Answer**:
- LiDAR provides precise 3D mapping and obstacle detection, important for navigation
- Cameras provide rich visual information for object recognition and scene understanding
- IMUs measure orientation and motion, critical for balance control

### Question 10
What is sensor fusion and why is it important in humanoid robotics? Describe one common fusion approach.

**Sample Answer**: Sensor fusion combines information from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive understanding. It provides redundancy, accuracy, and robustness. A common approach is Kalman filtering, which combines predictions from motion models with sensor measurements optimally.

## Essay Questions

### Question 11
Discuss the implications of embodied intelligence principles for the design of humanoid robots. How might these principles influence decisions about morphology, control strategies, and learning approaches? Support your answer with specific examples from the textbook content.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Understanding of embodied intelligence principles
- Connection between principles and robot design
- Specific examples from the content
- Critical analysis of design implications

### Question 12
Analyze the relationship between embodiment and cognition in artificial systems. Compare and contrast the embodied cognition approach with traditional computational approaches to AI. What evidence supports the embodied approach, and what are its potential limitations?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Clear explanation of both approaches
- Comparison of advantages and limitations
- Evidence supporting embodied cognition
- Critical evaluation of limitations

### Question 13
Evaluate the role of environmental interaction in intelligent behavior. How do concepts like affordances, sensorimotor contingencies, and enactivism challenge traditional views of perception and cognition? What are the practical implications for humanoid robot design and control?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Understanding of key concepts (affordances, sensorimotor contingencies, enactivism)
- Comparison with traditional views
- Practical implications for robot design
- Critical analysis of the approach

## Practical Application Questions

### Question 14
Design a simple experiment that demonstrates the concept of morphological computation. Describe the physical system, the task to be performed, and how the morphology contributes to the solution without requiring complex control algorithms.

**Sample Answer**: A compliant quadruped robot with spring-loaded legs traversing rough terrain. The compliance in the legs naturally adapts to ground irregularities, providing stable locomotion with minimal control complexity. The physical spring properties contribute to the locomotion task.

### Question 15
You are tasked with designing sensor configurations for a humanoid robot intended for household assistance. Consider the trade-offs between different sensor modalities and justify your choices based on the tasks the robot needs to perform. What sensor fusion techniques would you employ and why?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Appropriate sensor selection for tasks
- Justification of choices
- Understanding of sensor trade-offs
- Appropriate fusion techniques
- Consideration of practical constraints
