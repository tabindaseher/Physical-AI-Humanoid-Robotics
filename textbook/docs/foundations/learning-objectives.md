# Learning Objectives and Prerequisites for Physical AI Foundations

## Chapter Learning Objectives

This chapter establishes the foundational concepts for understanding Physical AI and embodied intelligence. After completing this chapter, students should be able to:

### Knowledge Objectives

1. **Distinguish Physical AI from Digital AI**: Students will be able to articulate the key differences between Physical AI and Digital AI systems, including their respective advantages, limitations, and appropriate applications.

2. **Explain Embodied Cognition Principles**: Students will understand the core principles of embodied cognition, including embodiment constraint, environmental coupling, structural coupling, and grounded cognition.

3. **Analyze Sensorimotor Systems**: Students will comprehend the roles of different sensor modalities (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) in humanoid robotics and how they enable perception and interaction.

4. **Evaluate Morphological Computation**: Students will understand how physical form and structure can contribute to intelligent behavior, reducing computational requirements.

5. **Describe Affordance Theory**: Students will grasp the concept of affordances and their role in perception-action coupling.

### Comprehension Objectives

1. **Compare Classical vs. Embodied Approaches**: Students will be able to contrast traditional computational approaches to AI with embodied intelligence principles and understand the implications of each.

2. **Analyze the Reality Gap**: Students will understand the challenges of transferring AI systems from simulation to reality and the causes of the reality gap problem.

3. **Evaluate Sensor Fusion Benefits**: Students will comprehend how combining multiple sensors improves robot perception capabilities and system robustness.

4. **Assess Environmental Coupling**: Students will understand how agents and environments form coupled systems and the implications for intelligent behavior.

### Application Objectives

1. **Design Embodied Behaviors**: Students will be able to design simple robot behaviors that exploit embodied intelligence principles rather than relying solely on internal computation.

2. **Analyze Affordances**: Students will be able to identify and analyze the affordances present in different environments for various types of agents.

3. **Evaluate Sensor Configurations**: Students will be able to design appropriate sensor configurations for specific humanoid robot applications.

4. **Apply Sensorimotor Contingencies**: Students will understand how to apply sensorimotor contingency theory to design perception-action loops.

### Analysis Objectives

1. **Critique Traditional AI Approaches**: Students will be able to critically analyze the limitations of classical AI approaches when applied to physical systems.

2. **Evaluate Morphological Design**: Students will be able to assess how different morphological designs affect cognitive and behavioral capabilities.

3. **Compare Control Strategies**: Students will understand the trade-offs between different control strategies in embodied systems.

4. **Analyze Learning Paradigms**: Students will be able to compare learning in virtual vs. physical environments.
