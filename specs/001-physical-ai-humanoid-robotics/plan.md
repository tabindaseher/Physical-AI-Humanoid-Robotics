## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Depth per section (intro vs advanced)
**Question:** What level of depth should be maintained in each section?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Introductory level (basic concepts and simple examples)
  - *Tradeoffs:* More accessible to beginners, but may lack technical depth needed for implementation
- **Option B:** Advanced level (detailed technical implementation)
  - *Tradeoffs:* More practical for real-world applications, but may be challenging for target audience
- **Option C:** Intermediate level (balance between accessibility and technical depth)
  - *Tradeoffs:* Balanced approach, accessible to target audience while providing practical skills

**Chosen Direction:** Option C (Intermediate level)
**Rationale:** Target audience is students learning embodied intelligence, requiring practical implementation skills while maintaining accessibility at Grade 10-12 level.

### Decision 2: Simulation-first vs ROS-first order
**Question:** Should students start with simulation environments or core ROS concepts?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Simulation-first (Unity/Gazebo → ROS 2)
  - *Tradeoffs:* Immediate visual engagement, but potential confusion about underlying architecture
- **Option B:** ROS-first (ROS 2 → Unity/Gazebo)
  - *Tradeoffs:* Strong architectural foundation, but delayed visual feedback
- **Option C:** Parallel introduction
  - *Tradeoffs:* Integrated understanding, but increased cognitive load

**Chosen Direction:** Option B (ROS-first)
**Rationale:** Aligns with the "Robotic Nervous System" concept. Students need to understand how robots communicate and coordinate before adding complex simulation environments.

### Decision 3: Level of code examples
**Question:** What proportion of content should be dedicated to code examples?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** High code level (70% code examples, 30% conceptual explanation)
  - *Tradeoffs:* More hands-on practice, but may overwhelm students with implementation details
- **Option B:** Balanced level (50% code examples, 50% conceptual explanation)
  - *Tradeoffs:* Good comprehension with practical application
- **Option C:** Low code level (30% code examples, 70% conceptual explanation)
  - *Tradeoffs:* Strong conceptual understanding, but insufficient practical application

**Chosen Direction:** Option B (Balanced level)
**Rationale:** Provides both conceptual understanding and practical application. Students need to understand both the "why" and "how" of robotics systems.

### Decision 4: Diagram format (Mermaid/ASCII)
**Question:** What format should be used for diagrams in the content?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** ASCII diagrams
  - *Tradeoffs:* Simple, version-controllable, but limited visual expressiveness
- **Option B:** Mermaid diagrams
  - *Tradeoffs:* More expressive and professional-looking, but requires Docusaurus Mermaid support
- **Option C:** Mixed approach
  - *Tradeoffs:* Flexibility to choose best tool for each diagram, but inconsistent appearance

**Chosen Direction:** Option B (Mermaid diagrams)
**Rationale:** Provides professional-looking, scalable diagrams that are still text-based and version-controllable. Mermaid diagrams integrate well with MDX and Docusaurus.
