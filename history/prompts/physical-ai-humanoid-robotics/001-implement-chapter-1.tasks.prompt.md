# Prompt

sp.implement

# Response

I've successfully completed all the tasks for Chapter 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. The implementation included:

1. Completed all 12 tasks for Chapter 1:
   - Tasks 1-3: Research phase (Physical AI definitions, embodied intelligence importance, Digital vs Physical AI comparison)
   - Tasks 4-6: Content creation phase (Introduction section, embodied intelligence section, comparison section)
   - Tasks 7-9: Visual and technical elements (Physical AI concept diagram, comparison diagram, code sample)
   - Tasks 10-12: Quality assurance (APA citations, reference validation, review checkpoint)

2. Created the following deliverables:
   - Research document with authoritative sources
   - Complete chapter content in MDX format
   - Two Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
   - Comprehensive Python code sample demonstrating Physical AI concepts
   - References in APA format with validation
   - Review checkpoint document summarizing completed work

3. Updated the tasks.md file to mark all Chapter 1 tasks as completed

All content follows the required structure: Concept → Explanation → Example → Code → Diagram → Summary, and meets the Grade 10-12 readability requirements with proper APA citations.
