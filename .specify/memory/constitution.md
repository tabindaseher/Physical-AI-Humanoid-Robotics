# AI/Spec-Driven Book Constitution
<!-- Constitution for the AI/Spec-Driven Book project -->

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
<!-- Every fact, concept, and technical detail must be verified against official sources -->
Content must be validated with ROS 2 docs, Gazebo docs, Unity docs, NVIDIA Isaac docs, Panaversity AI-Native curriculum, and provided Google Document; No hallucinated APIs or invented robotics concepts
<!-- All technical information must come from authoritative sources -->

### II. Clarity
<!-- Content must be accessible and well-structured for educational purposes -->
Educational, structured, simple presentation; Grade 10–12 clarity; No fluff, concise explanations; Short paragraphs and bullet points
<!-- Content should be easy to understand for the target audience -->

### III. Spec-driven Writing
<!-- Strict adherence to the prescribed module outline is required -->
Follow module outline exactly; Each module: 4–6 pages; Each chapter must contain: Key Terms, Learning Outcomes, Review Questions
<!-- Content must follow the specified structure and requirements -->

### IV. Consistency
<!-- Maintain uniformity across all content elements -->
Tone, formatting, MDX structure consistency; Format: Markdown/MDX (Docusaurus-ready); Diagrams: ASCII or Mermaid only; Code: Valid, runnable, or structurally correct
<!-- All content should follow consistent formatting and styling -->

### V. Verification
<!-- All content must be validated against official documentation -->
Validate with ROS 2 docs, Gazebo docs, Unity docs, NVIDIA Isaac docs, Panaversity AI-Native curriculum, and provided Google Document; No hallucinated APIs or invented robotics concepts
<!-- Content accuracy must be confirmed through official sources -->

### VI. Quarter Modules Adherence


Follow EXACT Module structure as specified: Module 1: ROS 2 — Robotic Nervous System (Nodes, Topics, Services, rclpy agent bridge, URDF for humanoids); Module 2: Digital Twin — Gazebo & Unity (Physics simulation, collisions, LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU); Module 3: AI-Robot Brain — NVIDIA Isaac (Isaac Sim, synthetic data, Isaac ROS VSLAM, Nav2 planning); Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) (Whisper voice→action, LLM planning, humanoid capstone project)

## Content Requirements
<!-- Specifications for content structure and elements -->

Each module must include: 2 diagrams + 1 real example + 1 code sample; Must include: Key Terms, Learning Outcomes, Review Questions; Format: Markdown/MDX (Docusaurus-ready); Structure: Concept → Explanation → Example → Code → Diagram → Summary
<!-- Content must follow the specified structural requirements -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Process for creating and reviewing content -->

All content follows specs exactly; No hallucinations; Docusaurus build passes cleanly; Publish-ready output; Each chapter: 4-6 pages with required elements
<!-- Content creation must follow the defined workflow and quality standards -->

## Governance
<!-- Rules governing the constitution and its application -->

Constitution supersedes all other practices; All content must comply with accuracy, clarity, spec-driven writing, consistency, and verification rules; Content must follow the exact module structure and quarter modules
<!-- The constitution governs all aspects of content creation for this project -->
